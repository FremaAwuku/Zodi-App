## So? What is Zodi-App?

Glad you asked! This isn't your run of the mill astrology app. Zodi-App allows users the ability to enter their birthdays calculate their sun signs and with that information get daily horoscopes that they can post and share with a community of other Zodi-App users, that you can potentially add as friends! Zodi-App allows users to keep track of past calculations as well as calculate compatibilities through a zodiac list!


## Application Structure

### Back End 

Restful API's were used as to organize routes 

* Python
   * boto3 (AWS Uploads)
* Flask
   * flask forms for backend validation 
* SQLAlchemy
   * self referncing model associations used to structure RDBMS
* PostgreSQL database


### Front End 

* JavaScript
   * aztroJS Wrapper for fetch sign based of Horoscopes(https://github.com/sameerkumar18/aztro/blob/master/docs/source/index.rst)

* React
   * Controlled inputs allowed user information to be recieved and kept in state improving performance. 
   * Components and a heavy use of Modals allowed for modulatrity seen throughout the app 

* Redux
  * The store consistently keeps user information uptodate allowing user to change their sign and have respective information change with it( ex. Daily Horoscope) 

* CSS
   * The idea behind the styling of this websit was to make it as "app" based as possible. With a switch of media consumption taking place on the phone. I wanted the user experience to simulate a "Zodi-Dex" where most useability was found on the users dashboard.
