        long_description=">With a zodiac sign ruled by Mars, the god of war, it's little surprise that Rams are known for being brave and tenacious. Aries signs are pioneers! They're the ones you call on to boldly go where none have gone before. Their fearlessness and courageousness make them the ideal people for trying new experiences, taking big risks, and breaking new ground >You'll rarely meet an Aries who isn't capable of finishing several things at once, often before lunch break! Their challenges show when they get impatient, aggressive and vent anger pointing it to other people. Strong personalities born under this sign have a task to fight for their goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork through this incarnation. >An Aries is not weighed down by the freedom of choice, and is perhaps the sign that is least conflicted about what they want. They throw themselves at the world eagerly and without fear. It is one of their most commendable qualities, but also what causes them a great deal of pain and grief. >It is likely that Aries do fall in love relatively quickly. They have a lot of energy, and they don’t want to waste too much time on trivial matters. While they enjoy taking the time to get to know a person, they may not do so for an extended period of time. Aries may consider themselves to be immediately aware of whether or not they are in love with someone. The decision to be in a relationship doesn’t take long for them. An Aries will have strong feelings about whether or not the relationship is working, and will be able to break things off without a great deal of difficulty. >When it comes to the workplace, the natural leadership abilities of an Aries can be a tremendous asset. These are the people who will take on a new project with an infectious enthusiasm. Their innate intelligence and quick-thinking ways make them the kind of people you can trust to handle any setbacks along the way")

They feel the need to always be surrounded by love and beauty, turned to the material world, hedonism, and physical pleasures. People born with their Sun in Taurus are sensual and tactile, considering touch and taste the most important of all senses. Stable and conservative, this is one of the most dependable signs of the zodiac, ready to endure and stick to their choices until they reach the point of personal satisfaction." ,
        long_description=
        ">The ruler of Taurus is Venus, the planet of love, attraction, beauty, satisfaction, creativity and gratitude. This tender nature will make Taurus an excellent cook, gardener, lover, and artist. They are loyal and don't like sudden changes, criticism or the chase of guilt people are often prone to, being somewhat dependable on other people and emotions they seem to be unable to let go of. Still, no matter their potential emotional challenge, these individuals have the ability to bring a practical voice of reason in any chaotic and unhealthy situation. >Most Taurus individuals are oriented around the physical world. They tend to be grounded and logical. They love routine and they’re committed to their own comfort. They like to be in control. They’re patient and steady, and their materialism is an extension of their pursuit of stability. >Taurus' are incredibly articulate with a great speaking voice. They are great listeners, highly observant, and their minds are like a sponge that soaks up and holds onto data and facts and stores them for that moment when they're needed or when they can be used to impress. > Because Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and romance, it makes this sign is one of the most sensual of the zodiac. Taurus energy is most turned on when its physical senses are titillated, which means cuddles, back rubs, and affection are an important part of how they give and receive love. This sign likes to feel comfortable and doesn't mind predictability, so they may not be the most adventurous when it comes to planning dates. However, they're one of the most devoted signs, so they make stable and patient partners who will stick with you through thick and thin — and they expect their lovers to be equally devoted and dependable > In their professional lives, Taureans are patient, reliable, and very thorough. When given a specific task, they'll address it with laser-sharp focus until it's complete. If you've got a Taurus employee or coworker, this is the person you want working on major projects that need a meticulous hand. That said, this intense concentration can make it difficult for the Taurus sign to focus on more than one task at a time, so it's usually best if they can work through a project in its entirety before starting on another"

        short_description="These curious twins are terrific pioneers, using their energy to spearhead innovative creative projects. A fearless thinker, Gemini is always down to try something new. But after they have shared their progressive vision with the world, it’s best to let these twins get back to ideating: These hyperactive air signs have short attention spans and are most satisfied when they can move fluidly from one idea to the next." ,
        long_description="> Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different personalities in one and you will never be sure which one you will face. They are sociable, communicative and ready for fun, with a tendency to suddenly get serious, thoughtful and restless. They are fascinated with the world itself, extremely curious, with a constant feeling that there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see. > Both Gemini and Virgo are governed by Mercury, the messenger planet of communication. Despite sharing a planetary ruler, however, these two signs are opposite in their approaches: Gemini expresses emotions externally, whereas Virgo processes internally. Gemini is all about output, so these twins love to chat and often speak with their hands (which happens to be the body part associated with Gemini). Communication is paramount for them, and they require fluent streams of transmission. >They love texting and tweeting almost as much as they love talking IRL. In fact, the act of expression is often even more important to loquacious Gemini than what is actually being said — and they must remember to be thoughtful with their words. Another incredible Gemini quality, however, is that these natural chameleons can quickly recover from even the most shameful foot-in-mouth moments. Gemini moves too fast to care about embarrassing missteps: They simply move on. > Fun and always ready for an intellectual challenge, Gemini sees love first through communication and verbal contact, and find it as important as physical contact with their partner. Inquisitive and always ready to flirt, a Gemini could spend a lot of time with different lovers until they find the right one who is able to match their intellect and energy. > In constant need of intellectual stimulation, the most suitable job for a Gemini has to be challenging to their brain. They are skillful, inventive and often very smart, with a need for a dynamic working environment and a lot of social contacts met in the office. The best careers they can choose are those of traders, inventors, writers, orators, preachers and lawyers, but any career that gives them the opportunity to communicate freely while keeping them on the move and busy at all times, is an excellent choice. As if they were created for multitasking, problem solving and bringing new ideas to life, they need a workplace that won't keep them stuck in a routinely, repetitive tasks that don't allow them to shine.",

        short_description="Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging zodiac signs to get to know. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about matters of the family and their home. Cancer is sympathetic and attached to people they keep close. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are very loyal and able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering" ,
        long_description= ">  Being ruled by the Moon, phases of the lunar cycle deepen Cancers internal mysteries and create fleeting emotional patterns that are beyond their control. Guided by emotion and their heart, Cancers could have a hard time blending into the world around them. As children, they don't have enough coping and defensive mechanisms for the outer world, and have to be approached with care and understanding, for that is what they give in return.> Cancers are homebodies. They like the comfort of the familiar,stability, and routine. Because of this, cancers tend to be less experimental than other signs. > Cancer naturally have an attraction to the vintage relics or nostalgic feelings of the past, and this may stem from their internal want to keep traditions alive. They like art that reminds them of a different time. > Cancer is a very emotional sign, and feelings are the most important thing in their relationships. Gentle and caring, they will show their sensibility to the world without even thinking they might get hurt. For partners, they always choose a person who is able to understand them through non-verbal, silent contact, and a shared daily routine, and their affection won't last long with superficial, flaky or unreliable partners. The lack of initiative these individuals suffer from won't make it easy for them to build a sex life they wish for, if they don't find a partner who is able to make them feel calm, protected, and free to express themselves. >In romance, Cancer is a giving and generous lover and expects the same in return. The Crab is above mind games and hates the thrill of the chase—if you love someone, why not say it now? It's not uncommon for Cancer to fall into committed love after just a few days or weeks, and even though that decision is sudden, it can easily last a lifetime. Cancers tends to be happiest when they're part of a pair, and the best relationship brings out their greatest traits. But even though a Cancer thrives in a duo, he or she also has an independent streak, and needs plenty of time to do things solo. This sign has an active internal life, and is often are happy living in the realm of imagination. Sometimes Cancers need help from one of the more grounded signs to make their dreams a reality. >When a job needs to get done, a Cancer will roll their sleeves up and finish it successfully. If they are left alone to work, they usually perform better than when surrounded by other people, loyal to their employer and focused on the task. They will have great careers as nurses, housekeepers, gardeners, politicians and decorators. >For Cancer representatives, security and money are of great importance and stand for the real reason they work as much as they do. They easily earn money and aren't used to spending it all in one day. It is their goal to save, invest, and watch their investments grow daily. Resourceful and good at managing time and finances, this is a sign that is often in charge of all money in the household, keeping their partner or other family members under control",

They are dramatic, creative, self-confident, dominant and extremely difficult to resist, able to achieve anything they want to in any area of life they commit to. There is a specific strength to a Leo and their 'king of the jungle' status. Leo often has many friends for they are generous and loyal. Self-confident and attractive, this is a Sun sign capable of uniting different groups of people and leading them as one towards a shared cause, and their healthy sense of humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.",
        long_description= "> Leo belongs to the element of Fire, just like Aries and Sagittarius. This makes them warmhearted, in love with life, trying to laugh and have a good time. Able to use their mind to solve even the most difficult problems, they will easily take initiative in resolving various complicated situations. Ruled by the Sun, Leo worships this fiery entity in the sky, quite literally as well as metaphorically. They are in search for self-awareness and in constant growth of ego. Aware of their desires and personality, they can easily ask for everything they need, but could just as easily unconsciously neglect the needs of other people in their chase for personal gain or status. When a Leo representative becomes too fond and attached to their achievements and the way other people see them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.> This Fire sign is passionate and sincere and its representatives show their feelings with ease and clarity. When in love, they are fun, loyal, respectful and very generous towards their loved one. They will take the role of a leader in any relationship, and strongly rely on their need for independency and initiative. This can be tiring for their partner at times, especially if they start imposing their will and organizing things that aren't theirs to organize in the first place. Each Leo needs a partner who is self-aware, reasonable and on the same intellectual level as them. Their partner also has to feel free to express and fight for themselves, or too much light from their Leo's Sun might burn their own personality down.> Sex life of each Leo is an adventure, fun and very energetic. This is someone who has a clear understanding of boundaries between sex and love, but might fail to see how important intimacy and emotional connection is to the quality of their sex life. Every Leo needs a partner to fight through their awareness and reach their sensitive, subconscious core, in order to find true satisfaction in a meaningful relationship >Leos are highly energetic and tend to always be busy, no matter the need for their employment. They are ambitious, creative and optimistic and once they dedicate to their work, they will do everything just right. The best possible situation they can find themselves in is to be their own bosses or manage others with as little control from their superiors as possible. Jobs that allow open expression of artistic talent, such as acting and entertainment, are ideal for a Leo. Management, education and politics are also a good fit, as well as anything that puts them in a leadership position which naturally suits them.",

        short_description="Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they won’t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.",
        long_description= ">Since Mercury is the ruling planet of this sign, its representatives have a well-developed sense of speech and writing, as well as all other forms of communication. Many Virgos may choose to pursue a career as writers, journalists, and typists, but their need to serve others makes them feel good as caregivers, on a clear mission to help. >Virgo is an Earth sign, fitting perfectly between Taurus and Capricorn. This will lead to a strong character, but one that prefers conservative, well-organized things and a lot of practicality in their everyday life. These individuals have an organized life, and even when they let go to chaos, their goals and dreams still have strictly defined borders in their mind. Constantly worried that they missed a detail that will be impossible to fix, they can get stuck in details, becoming overly critical and concerned about matters that nobody else seems to care much about. >The sign of Virgo in love leads to its tragic inability to feel worthy, beautiful, or lovable. Compatibility of Virgo with other zodiac signs is mostly based on the ability of their partner to give them all the love they need to start feeling safe and open up enough to show their soft, vulnerable heart. They will rarely have direct statements of love, but intimacy brings out all of the beauty of their emotional self-expression. A Virgo will prefer a stable relationship than having fun, casual lovers, except if they become one, using their charm and superficial communication to win hearts without ever investing their own. Methodical and intellectually dominant, each Virgo seems to have an equation in their mind that their partner has to follow.Trust needs to be built with Virgo, slowly, steadily and patiently, and each partner they have in life has a chance to be nurtured and cared for, but only if they give enough to deserve special treatment of Virgo. >Virgo stands for all practical and used things, and it is in the nature of these individuals to save money and always put something on the side. They will see irrational spending as a bad habit or a matter of being spoiled, and always hold on to practical solutions that don’t cost much. Unfortunately, this approach can sometimes make them a bit cheap and too concerned about everything they might lack tomorrow. They need to learn to indulge in some hedonism too. >Virgos are practical, analytical and hard-working, always knowing exactly where to look for the core of any problem. Their methodology makes them shine at jobs that require good organization, dealing with paperwork, problem solving and working with their minds and their hands. When they focus, perfection is to be expected from their work, for no other sign has such an eye for details as Virgo. In love with books and artistic expression, they make good critics, while their need to help humankind serves them best if they decide to become doctors, nurses or psychologists.",

Partnership is very important for them, seeking someone with the ability to be the mirror to themselves. These individuals are fascinated by balance and symmetry, they are in a constant chase for justice and equality, realizing through life that the only thing that should be truly important to themselves in their own inner core of personality. This is someone ready to do nearly anything to avoid conflict, keeping the peace whenever possible" ,
        long_description= " >Planet ruling the sign of Libra is Venus, making these people great lovers but also fond of expensive, material things. Their lives need to be enriched by music, art, and beautiful places they get a chance to visit. >Libras are difficult to really understand because they seem so contradictory on the surface. They’re simultaneously extroverted and introverted, strategic and spontaneous, focused and intuitive. This variability makes it difficult to pin down their true character. They are an entire constellation of personalities. Libras are different depending on who they're around. >Libra is the sign of marriage, making its representatives open for traditional pathways of love. Even though the element of Air gives them a lot of flexibility, they will still feel the strong pull towards tradition and their desires will eventually turn to love put on paper, well-organized and serving a purpose to create a certain image for the outer world. In a way, each Libra is in search of a partner who has the ability to set clear boundaries, as if expecting to be protected by them but without their pride being endangered in the process. >They want to be admired not for their talents but for their charm. They want to be seen as the responsible figure who can balance out the turbulent elements around them. They feel an intense amount of guilt and shame when they are unhappy because they know that their unhappiness affects everyone around them. >For each Libra, the key to a happy life is in a fine balance, meaning they will not commit to work without setting apart enough time for their private life and their loved ones, and if they do, they will feel like they need to set free from it. They can be loved leaders even though they sometimes lack the initiative needed to organize people who work for them, and will work hard to deserve privileges that come their way. In search for truth and justice, they are good lawyers and judges, and can also be successful as diplomats, designers and composers if they have nurtured their artistic side from childhood. They will work well in a group, and can be convincing and gifted speakers. >Financial aspect of their lives is often under control, which probably wouldn’t be the case if they had an easier time deciding what they want to buy. As soon as they start questioning their financial choices, chances are they won’t even spend any money at all, simply because it was hard to make a decision of any kind. They balance between saving and spending pretty well and even though they enjoy fashion and fine clothes, they rarely let their desires for spending get the best of them.",

They will hold on to other people’s secrets, even when they aren’t very fond of them to begin with and do anything they can for those they tie themselves to." ,

These individuals are known for being calm and cool, looking mysterious and hard to figure out. There is a deep understanding of the rules of the Universe inside every Scorpio that gives them the power others rush through life rarely recognizing within. >Scorpios socialize from behind a double-sided mirror, always scanning, reading you while you can only see your own reflection. They prefer to be the people asking the questions. They remove your skin with their perceptive scalpel and take inventory of your pulsing viscera. They probe and push. They know the little things that make you tick. Your pressure points. The subtle ways to procure the answer they’re seeking. They are keenly aware of power, its flows, and their position within its matrix. >Despite their ability to be generally popular, there’s something very lonely about Scorpios. They have a ruthless view of the world. Eat or be eaten. Every human interaction is a meeting of opposing powerful forces. A clashing of wants and needs where somebody wins and somebody loses. Their knowledge of other people’s internal structures gives them an edge over the competition. >Scorpios wish to become one with their loved one, searching through the zodiac only to find the perfect match for their heart.This isn’t a sign that lacks initiative, and since their sex life is of great importance to them, they might find themselves in casual one-night stands and relationships that don’t satisfy their emotional needs. However, this won’t make them happy for long and they won’t settle for this way of life for very long. Once their adventurous and curious nature finds a bit of peace with age, they will learn that without emotion, sexual experience serves no purpose at all. >Once they fall in love, they tend to be dedicated and faithful, and sometimes obsessive, possessive and overwhelming as well. Being extremely sensitive even when they don’t admit this to the world, they will choose partners carefully and need a lot of time to build trust and respect with anyone. >There is something almost disturbing in the dedication Scorpio has for a goal they set out to achieve, and this makes them fantastic in management and problem-solving that needs a lot of energy and effort put in. They won’t give up under pressure and work well in stressful environments that need a calm and steady hand. The best career choices for Scorpios are science and research of any kind, and they are excellent being detectives, cops, psychologists, and surgeons. Their ultimate respect for other people can make them a bit difficult in teamwork, for they expect the same treatment in return even from people incapable of such approach. >Scorpios are disciplined enough to stick to the budget, but enjoy living their life on the edge. They will work hard for their money and do everything in their power to be independent, but easily get indebted, get loans or mortgages, handling money that isn’t even theirs. Still, in most cases, money gives these individuals a sense of control and power, and they will rarely take risks they aren’t sure will pay off in time.",

Their enthusiasm has no boundaries, and these people possess a great sense of humor accompanied by intense curiosity. In need of absolute freedom, their adventurous spirit takes them from one end of the world to the other, exploring different cultures and philosophies. >Sagittarius is an explorer. They are both the fearless adventurer and the jaded critic. They understand that knowledge comes in two forms: the shallow, disposable kind that comes from external sources, and the kind that comes from within. Sagittarius knows that external knowledge can be easily gained while internal knowledge is exponentially deeper and more powerful. They’re on a quest to delve into the depths of the universe inside the human mind. They don’t do this to prove that they have all the answers, but instead because they know that the journey is the destination. >People born with the Sun in Sagittarius are playful, humorous, and they will enjoy having their relationships fun and carefree. They are in search for partners who are equally open-minded to suit their passionate, expressive nature. Always in the mood to try out something new and exciting, they have a hard time recognize the line between friendships and love, as well as between love and sexual relationships. >Sagittarius representatives want their partners intellectual, stimulating all of their senses, gentle enough while at the same time firm and specific about their opinions and choices. With the ability to respect almost anyone, always expecting the best in people that come into their life, this is a sign of belief and disappointment and isn’t always in sync with the happiest of love stories. If a Sagittarius holds on too firmly for their mental strength and processes, dismissing tenderness and emotion that should lead the way, they could end up in a series of meaningless relationships with partners who don’t even make their heart jump. >When a Sagittarius visualizes something in their mind, they get clear focus and will do everything they can to bring their visions down to Earth. Still, this focus often gets lost and distracted along the way, and it is one of their great challenges to follow the arrow they shot until it hits, or misses its target. They enjoy a dynamic work atmosphere and teamwork, being the one to lift the spirits of others when they are tired or feeling down. Jobs that suit them best are those of a travel agent, photographer, researcher, ambassador, and all freelance activities that give them enough room to organize their own time. >Money can easily become a weak spot of each Sagittarius, simply because overspending becomes their way of life if they set free to all of their cravings. Their perspective is extremely positive and with awareness that there is so much to see, possess, touch and smell in this world, they feel it would be a shame to waste any time waiting, saving, or carefully planning their finances. They will take risks they don’t have to take, sometimes wearing pink goggles and ending up disappointed, but always deeply believing that the Universe will provide them with everything they need. >Money can easily become a weak spot of each Sagittarius, simply because overspending becomes their way of life if they set free to all of their cravings.

They need to learn to forgive in order to make their own life lighter and more positive. >Capricorns are constantly competing with themselves. They do want praise, though. Not adulation, just praise. Praise is a simple acknowledgment of a job well done. Praise is a pat on the back. They use this as validation to compensate for general feelings of incompetence and inferiority. They plow through adversity with blinders on until they reach success. >They are incredibly pragmatic. They are rule followers with a highly developed moral compass. From a young age it is impressed upon them that their whole sense of worth and meaning is based on their ability to hunker down and force their way to the finish. This turns them into achievement junkies. Their drive to succeed is a reflection of their fear of failure. The most stressful time in a Capricorn’s life is when they question their own authority. When a Capricorn is in a position of power, they are most stable. When they’re put in a position where they have to cater to someone else’s agenda, they can become a little unhinged. >It is not easy to win over the attention and the heart of a Capricorn, but once their walls break and their heart melts they stay committed for a lifetime. Their Their relationships with other signs can be challenging due to their difficult character, but any shared feeling that comes from such a deep emotional place is a reward for their partner’s efforts. Shown sensitivity comes through acts rather than words, and years are often needed for them to open enough to chat about their actual emotional problems. >Turned to their personal goals, whatever they might be, Capricorns can lack compassion and emotion when relating to their loved ones. The certain ease of a “normal” life is something they will give with full devotion, and their partner will be able to rely on them, use them as a stepping stone for any personal endeavor, and have a lasting bond with a constant tendency of growth. Still, this isn’t someone willing to compromise much, and seems to have the need to create a problem only to resolve it or feel bad that it was never resolved before. >Capricorns will set high standards for themselves, but their honesty, dedication and perseverance will lead them to their goals. They value loyalty and hard work over all other things, and keep associates with these qualities close even when they might be intellectually inferior. Concentrated and resourceful, this is someone who gets the job done, doesn’t mind long hours, and commits to the final product completely. They shine in jobs that include management, finance, programming and calculations. Deeply rooted in tradition, the state, and the system they live in, a Capricorn needs all of their paperwork in perfect order, their documents clean, and their file impeccable. >Money will be truly valued in lives of these individuals, and they won’t have much trouble managing it and saving some for a rainy day, for as long as their debts don’t swallow their actual abilities. Hard workers with a higher cause, they will do anything they can to set free from a loan or a mortgage of any time, but also know that true success will only come in the long run." ,

        short_description="Aquarius is the sign different from the rest of the zodiac and people born with their Sun in it feel special. This makes them eccentric and energetic in their fight for freedom, or at times shy and quiet, afraid to express their true personality. In both cases they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love to fight for idealistic causes. They are able to see people without prejudice and this makes them truly special. Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius representatives have a deep need to have some time alone and away from everything in order to restore power.",
        long_description=">Uranus is the ruler of Aquarius, shoulder to shoulder with its traditional ruler – Saturn. Although Uranus has an abrupt, timid, and sometimes aggressive nature, their other ruler often grounds them enough and helps them find enough distance from other people to remain somewhat indifferent. A visionary and someone ready for changes, an Aquarius is a known thinker and someone who will shake your world once they are in it. They feel best as a part of a certain community, but might have trouble finding just the right place where they feel they belong. >“Intelligence,” to them, means the ability to formulate the most unpopular opinion possible. If they were white sheep, they’d dye their wool black just to prove a point. They are destined to live their lives in direct opposition to the current world. In fact, they are world-builders. An entire universe exists in their heads, and this universe adheres to its own set of logic that doesn’t map onto reality. They are not liars. They are utopians. They are not cold. They are rational. To them, emotions are just holes in their idealistic vessels. Why succumb to sensitivity when there is so much knowledge to acquire, so many problems to be solved, worlds to invent? >They sometimes ask, “Why can’t I be normal?” but in reality, they find normalcy boring, and they stake their self worth on their ability to be interesting. They want to be unknowable. They want to evade definition. Definitions are binding little rules that other people use to restrict their movement, and they must resist anything that infringes on their freedom to drift. Between definitions, between the individual and the common, between themselves and humanity. The ultimate Aquarian struggle is resolving the tension between their need for community, and their need for complete detachment. >Being the sign of freedom and solitude, Aquarius can be too difficult to be with for some static and passive signs of the zodiac.Integrity and honesty are essential for anyone who wants to stay in their life, and feelings won’t have much to do with the way they treat betrayal and those who let them down along the way. They will give independence to their partner, seeing them as equal and just as powerful as they are. Even though they can get all the freedom they desire, they could still have trouble with day to day interaction even with those they are deeply in love with. >Intellectual stimulation is by far the greatest aphrodisiac for an Aquarius. There's nothing that can attract them more than an interesting conversation with a person. Openness, communication, imagination and willingness to risk are the qualities that fit well in the emotional world of this zodiac sign. Their compatibility with other signs can be complex for they represent the opposition itself and have trouble relating to others if their sense of freedom is in any way endangered, or they perceive it to be. >This is a sign that brings enthusiasm, excitement, and innovations to their workplace and has a remarkable ability of exploitation of their imagination for business purposes. Their high intellect combined with their willingness to share their talents, inspires many people in their lives. They are a visionary who likes to engage in humane activities, and needs to work in a place that supports better circumstances for endangered groups of people. >Finances of this zodiac sign can be spent on various risks but also held on to, and all they need to have in order to create a saving zone out of their life, is to give them something to look forward to. They are well adapted to their feel for style and are not afraid to show it, which is why their colors shining in the outer world make all the difference for their emotional state. They feel extremely good in professions such as piloting, paragliding and photography, but also make excellent programmers, ingenious mathematicians and scientists, and need to show their personality with not strict guidelines for the way to do so.",

People born with their Sun in Pisces have an intuitive understanding of the life cycle and form incredible emotional relationship with other humans on the basis of natural order and senses guiding them",
        long_description=">Ruling planets of the sign of Pisces and Neptune and Jupiter, and intuition is the strongest suit of their kind. Connected to art, music, and any sort of liberal expression, every Pisces representative has a talent they need to use to feel creative and free. Tolerant and compassionate, they could do too much for other people out of good intentions, forgetting about their own wellbeing in the process. >Describing a Pisces’ personality can be difficult because Pisces tend to evade distinction. Their behavior changes significantly based on who they’re around. Pisces are just permeable membranes that pensively let things flow through them. They are cerebral sea sponges. They are boundless. They tend to dilute themselves with larger personalities to avoid having to form coherent identities. >Most of the qualities usually associated with Pisces (dreaminess, emotionality, imagination) are internal processes that are difficult to observe from the outside. This is because Pisces are primarily inward-facing. They are not self-absorbed, but they are absorbed in themselves. >The sign of Pisces is a sign of incorrigible romantics, for it exalts Venus and serves love, devotion, pleasure and all that is beautiful and tender. They are very gentle and extremely generous with their partner, but in search for love tend to forget about their moral values from time to time. They need to feel a real connection with their partners in order to open up and find that inner sense of absolute faith in an ideal love that drives them away from any idea of change. >Short-term relationships and adventures are not typical for this zodiac sign, although they have a changeable note to them that allows them to be quite carefree when it comes to choosing a new daily fling. Once they discover the inner state of belief in someone they start sharing their life with, they become deeply loyal and honest, as if their sole purpose in life was to find the person standing in front of them and making them happy. >Intuitive and dreamy, Pisces feel best in a position where their creative skills will come to the fore or working for a higher cause through creative charity events. Occupations that fit Pisces are compassionate and filled with faith and devotion, so they make excellent priests, doctors, veterinarians, musicians, painters and any career that involves working in the shadows. Undercover and hidden, they could have a lot of fun playing certain parts and hiding their true identity. >For the most part, Pisces don’t give money too much thought. They are usually more focused on their dreams and goals and will only try to make enough money to achieve them. Depending on the power of the dream they carry within, and the sense of purpose they were nurtured to build, each Pisces representative spends as much as needed to follow them." ,
